Introduction of a methyl group at the C4 position of 6 gave compound 9, which was 20-fold more potent and similarly as selective as 6. Installation of a methyl group at 6-position provided compound 10, which significantly lost the potency."

Replacement of cyanoazauracil group of 15 with acid isostere oxadiazolone and 3-amino-3-oxopropanoic acid provided compounds 19 and 20, which were 7-fold less potent and 2-to 3-fold less selective than 15.
