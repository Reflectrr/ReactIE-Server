PPh3 proved to be the optimal choice and afforded the product 3aa in 57% yield. Early efforts for asymmetric variant were focused on the screening of classical chiral di- or monophosphine ligands. We commenced our investigation using Pd2dba3·CHCl3 (2.5 mol %)/BINAP",

Unfortunately, the dicyclohexylamine-derived ligand L8, which had proven to be very effective in annulation of VECs 1 and coumalate 2, gave the desired cycloadduct 5aa in 71% yield with 75% ee (Table 3, entry 1). Therefore, those similar phosphoramidite ligands to L8 were re-evaluated. With the use of L6 as the ligand, the product 5aa was obtained with 91% ee, albeit in moderate yield (entry 2). Both yield and ee were moderate when the bis(iso-propyl)-substituted L7 was used (entry 2). H8-BINOL-based phosphorus amidite ligand L9 resulted in a similar yield and a lower ee, compared with its template Ligand L6 (entry 4). In order to achieve satisfactory yield and ee, more chiral phosphoramidite ligands were prepared and evaluated. The ligands L10 and L11 with large substituents at nitrogen atom did not promote the reaction (entries 5–6). The dicycloalkylamine-derived phosphoramidite ligands L12 and L13 was also prepared, which delivered high ees (75 and 85%) but moderate yields (54 and 51%) (entries 7–8). Both moderate yield and moderate ee were obtained when diphenylamine-derived ligand L14 was employed (entry 9).",
