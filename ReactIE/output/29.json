            "text": "Although the synthesis of the Grignard reagent proceeded smoothly, there were safety and environmental concerns over the use of superstoichiometric amounts of n-butyllithium and n-butylmagnesium chloride, which were needed to generate the active “ate” complex 3 under cryogenic conditions. A slight excess of n-butyllithium was required for this reaction to proceed robustly, as it was observed that only the “ate” complex was active in the reaction and the corresponding dibutylmagnesium species was completely inactive toward Br–Mg exchange. Moreover, when the reaction was performed under noncryogenic conditions, impurity 11 resulting from addition of a butyl group at the 3-position of the indole (Figure 2) was poorly controlled. The use of alternative Grignard technologies, such as the isopropylmagnesium chloride–lithium chloride reagent developed by Knochel, was unsuccessful. The diethyl chlorophosphite electrophile used in the process is highly toxic and moisture-sensitive, representing potential handling/quality issues, and the resulting toluene solution of the ethyl H-phosphinate product 5 had to be stored in a cold room because of concerns over its stability. The palladium-catalyzed P–C coupling performed well, but the product 7 was isolated in only 53% yield over the two stages. However, this chemistry installed the ethyl phosphinate 7 rather than the required methyl phosphinate 8, which required later modification in the synthesis. These steps involved the use of dichloromethane, a nonpreferred solvent, and the combination of oxalyl chloride and DMF, which is known to generate dimethylcarbamoyl chloride (DMCC) as a byproduct, as well as the gaseous byproducts generated during processing, which presented potential engineering/safety issues. DMCC is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen, and its generation is strictly governed by COMAH regulations in the U.K. Some of the batches of bromotrimethylsilane had been shown in the laboratory to partially isomerize the cinnamonitrile double bond, forming impurity 12 (Figure 2), which was difficult to purge in the downstream chemistry. This impurity is probably formed as a result of the presence of small quantities of HBr present in the bromotrimethylsilane.",
