The model generated by Rosetta indicates that the structurally ordered lid packs with only a small void apparent (Figure S7Des2) and 2IP retains π–π stacking with the isoalloxazine ring of FMN (FiguresS6 and S7es2). In addition, aromatic side chains of the lid stack together with a Tyr of the second subunit of the native α2-homodimer. Together, F165, W169, and L173 of the lid provide a relatively nonpolar environment for 2IP binding (Figures S7E and S7Fes2). To identify the residues most responsible for the improved activity with 2IP, each substitution used to convert HsIYD to UD08 was individually evaluated within the context of the wild-type sequence. These new variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and characterized by their ability to dehalogenate 2IP in analogy to the screen above (Figure S8 and TableS9es2 in the Supporting Information).",

I-Tyr was then transformed to 2IP in the best scored structure by deleting the coordinates of its zwitterion and β-carbon. Since IYD is a homodimer with two identical and independent active sites, ligand substitution and subsequent computational substitution of the lid sequence were applied to only one of the two active sites. Parameterization of the small molecules I-Tyr, 2IP, and FMN was performed as recommended by PyRosetta.",
