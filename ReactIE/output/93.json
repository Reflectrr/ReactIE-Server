Peptide KSL-128018 had a 50-fold increase in affinity corresponding to a Ki value of 40 nM (Figure 2D and Table S1). The Kd value of the 5,6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled KSL-128018 peptide to syntenin PDZ1-2 was determined to be 30 nM (Table S1). This is, to the best of our knowledge, the most potent monomeric inhibitor reported for any PDZ domain.",
