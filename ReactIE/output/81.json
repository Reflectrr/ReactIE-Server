The product was then hydrolyzed in 6 M HCl and purified for analytical work by preparative high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to give the PC2A-BP chelator (Scheme 1).",

The reaction mixture was heated to 60 °C by using an oil bath, and 0.118 g (0.580 mmol) of 4-phenylbenzyl chloride dissolved in 5 mL of dry acetonitrile was added to the suspension dropwise during 3 h. The reaction mixture was stirred at the given temperature for 40 h and filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The oily residue was redissolved in 10 mL of 12 M HCl, and the solution was refluxed for 25 h at 110 °C. The reaction mixture was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue was redissolved in 4 mL of double distilled water. Separation via preparative HPLC (Figure S12) yielded PC2A-BP as an off white solid upon freeze-drying the combined fractions containing the product.",
