            "text": "The bifunctional linker 1 was prepared by treating 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)benzene with one equiv of sodium cyclopentadienylide. For the photosensitizer part, a zinc(II) phthalocyanine core was used due to its superior photophysical properties and high photostability. To facilitate the coupling through the cyclopentadiene moiety of the linker, a maleimide unit was introduced to the phthalocyanine. With an electron-deficient and sterically unhindered π system, maleimide serves as an excellent dienophile. Compared to furan and 2,4-hexadiene derivatives, maleimide has a much higher reactivity toward cyclopentadiene and the resulting endo cycloadduct also has a higher thermal stability which does not undergo the retro-Diels–Alder reaction below 275 °C. Moreover, the Diels–Alder cycloadducts are generally more stable in serum than the maleimide–thiol conjugates formed via Michael addition.",

Various peptide concentrations and solvent systems were used, and the yield of the product was determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information and Table 1, the use of a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.0) (1:1 v/v) as a solvent could lead to the formation of cyclic peptide 3 in 74 and 55% HPLC yield after 2 h when a peptide concentration of 0.5 and 1 mM was used, respectively. Some side products were also formed in this reaction.",
