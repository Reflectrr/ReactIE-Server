Given that negligible conversion is observed in the absence of precatalyst, the formation of 2f in the case of the JosiPhos catalyst system presumably arises from the formation of 2e followed by a subsequent N-arylation step that is not favored in the case of (CyPBn-Cy)Ni(o-tol)Cl. The preferred formation of the more hindered tertiary amine 2f (versus 2e) in this context contrasts the negligible conversion of the hindered electrophile 2-chloro-m-xylene noted herein with this precatalyst, suggesting that the origins of diarylation selectivity in this case are likely not simply steric in nature.",
