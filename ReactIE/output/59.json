Mock and co-workers found that macrocyclic P3N3 and P4N4 chromium complexes formed from CrCl2(THF) and P2N2. Heterolytic cleavage of an α-C(sp3)–H bond by a binuclear [FeFe]-dithiolate complex was observed by Wang, Hall, and co-workers. Cleavage of α-C–H bonds of phosphine ligands has been reported in redox reactions of mononuclear Fe diphosphine complexes. Deprotonation of α-C–H bonds by base in Ni complexes has been reported, particularly in the formation of pincer ligands.",

The product of P–C bond cleavage, 3a, was isolated in 62% yield and was characterized by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.

            "text": "To examine the effect of the length of the diphosphine linker on the stability of the heteroleptic Ni complex 2 and the P–C/C–H bond cleavage reactivity, we prepared complex 2b, which contains dmpm, a diphosphine ligand with a C1 linker and thereby a small bite angle. The dark green complex 2b was readily synthesized from 1 and dmpm in acetonitrile and isolated as a pure solid. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of 2b in acetonitrile solution shows triplets at 11.8 and −59.4 ppm assigned to the phosphorus nuclei of P2N2 and dmpm, respectively. The X-ray crystal structure of 2b showed a pentacoordinate geometry similar to that of 2d, with one phosphine of the P2N2 ligand residing at the axial position of the distorted square pyramid and one bound acetonitrile at the equatorial position (Figure 3).",
