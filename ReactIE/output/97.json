Neither nitrite anion nor nitrous acid formed by protonation of the former reacts with the unprotonated amine. The effective nitrosating agent is instead formed from the nucleophilic attack of a nucleophilic species X– to the protonated nitrous acid in a rapid equilibrium step (Scheme 7). In the absence of other nucleophiles, with high HNO2 concentration and pH > – 0.6, nitrite ion acts as the nucleophile X– and the reactive nitrosating agent is nitrous anhydride N2O3. Under very acidic conditions (pH < −0.6), the in situ formed HNO2 leads to the nitrosonium ion NO+. Another nitrosating agent, H2NO2+, can also operate at low concentrations of HNO2 and pH > −0.6. Finally, if a nucleophilic species X– is present, NOX type nitrosating agents will be formed.",
