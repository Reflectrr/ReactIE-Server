EPR studies (see the Supporting Information) and solution magnetic susceptibility measurements (CH2Cl2, Evans method) clearly show that this compound is a low-spin complex. The solution effective magnetic moment of 1.8(1) μB is in agreement with a low-spin d5 center (one unpaired electron). Complex 5 exhibits a strong band at 1654 cm–1 in the IR spectrum assignable to the NO frequency. In the X-band EPR spectrum, recorded in CH2Cl2 at 298 K, this compound displays an isotropic multiplet at giso = 1.9963 with a well-resolved hyperfine coupling to the nitrogen and phosphorus atoms (AN = 5.5 G and AP = 26.9 G) and again is consistent with low-spin Cr(I)",
