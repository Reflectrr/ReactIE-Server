Then, the corresponding compound A reacted with 3-bromopropyne in the presence of K2CO3 to obtain the corresponding target compounds A5–A8. In terms of compound A4, the coupling reaction of intermediate a5 bearing -Br at R and cyclopropylboronic acid yielded a6, along with reductive amination with l-alanine hydrochloride in the presence of NaBH3(CN) to produce the target compound A4.",
