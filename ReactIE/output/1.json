In 18, to elucidate whether the presence of the original d-phenylalanine residue is critical for biological activity, d-Phe was replaced with a d-Pro to generate an “ideal” β-turn, and both valine residues were replaced by Ile. The Val/Ile exchange in this case was performed to compensate for the loss of hydrophobicity caused by the Phe/Pro mutation.",
