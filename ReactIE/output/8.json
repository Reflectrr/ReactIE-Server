            "text": "We have shown previously that scorpionate-supported rare-earth-metal methyl complexes TptBu,MeLuMe2 and TptBu,MeLn(AlMe4)Me give access to mixed methyl alkyl Ln(III) complexes TptBu,MeLuRMe (R = CH2SiMe3, CH2Ph). Therefore, it was reasoned that the role of these versatile precursors might be expanded to selective protonolyses with phenols as well as salt metatheses with potassium phenolates, respectively. We set out to treat TptBu,MeLuMe2, supposedly the most reactive because sterically least hindered, with various alkyl-substituted phenol derivatives HOAr (HOC6H3Me2-2,6, HOC6H3iPr2-2,6, HOC6H3(CF3)2-3,5, HOC6H2tBu2-2,6-Me-4) (Scheme 1). The reaction of TptBu,MeLuMe2 with an equimolar amount of the least bulky HOC6H3Me2-2,6 in n-hexane at ambient temperature was indicated by an instant methane evolution. After evaporation of the solvent, crystallization from n-hexane afforded colorless crystals identified as bis(aryloxy) derivatives TptBu,MeLu(OC6H3Me2-2,6)2 (1-Lu) and reactant TptBu,MeLuMe2 via 1H NMR spectroscopy. The formation of 1-Lu (via ligand redistribution or double protonolysis) could not be prevented by performing the reaction at lower temperature (−40 °C). The same behavior was found when carrying out the reaction in toluene. In order to obtain the bis(aryloxy) lutetium complex more efficiently, the reaction was carried out with 2 equiv of the respective phenol. Similarly, protonolysis of TptBu,MeLuMe2 with 1 equiv HOC6H3iPr2-2,6 in n-hexane led to the bis(aryloxy) derivative TptBu,MeLu(OC6H3iPr2-2,6)2 (2-Lu), even though the sterics of the respective phenol were markedly increased. The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra of 1-Lu and 2-Lu at ambient temperatures showed only one set of signals for the pyrazolyl groups of the TptBu,Me ligand, similar to that of the starting compound.",

Therefore, a precooled solution of the reactant TptBu,MeLuMe2 in toluene was prepared and the respective phenol was added. Crystallization of the residue from toluene gave the bis(aryloxy) derivative TptBu,MeLu[OC6H3(CF3)2-3,5]2 (3-Lu) in good yield.

Subsequently, milder reaction conditions (4 h at −35 °C) were chosen for the effective synthesis of 7-Y. The 1H NMR spectra of 7-Lu and 7-Y show similar shifts of the Ln–C(Me) moiety at δ = 0.37 and 0.27 ppm (doublet with 2J(YH) = 1.8 Hz). Compared to other Me/OAr congeners a shift to higher fields was observed, which is in accordance with the electron-withdrawing CF3 groups of the aryloxy ligand. 19F NMR spectroscopy clearly identified both complexes at δ = −62.6 ppm (7-Y and 7-Lu), but unfortunately the expected quartet for the C–F coupling was hardly visible in the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum (7-Y: 132.3 ppm; 7-Lu: 132.1 ppm) and could also not be detected with longer measurement times due to decomposition of the complexes in solution, especially for 7-Y. Despite this, Ln–C(Me) carbon resonances were found at δ = 22.3 ppm as a doublet for yttrium (1J(YC) = 50.8 Hz) and as a singlet for lutetium at δ = 32.2 ppm.
