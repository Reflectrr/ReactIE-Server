We also describe the use of this material as an efficient and stable catalyst of the Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. Because ZrPd3 and ZrC share the same cation, Pd–ZrC was synthesized by simply calcining PZSA and Pd acetate. Using this approach, we found that nanoporous structures were generated in situ on ZrC NPs, realizing a support characterized by a high surface area (444 m2 g–1).",

Although the peaks arising from carbon compounds could not be observed in the powder XRD plots, the obtained powder is black, suggesting the presence of amorphous carbon (Figure 1c). Indeed, HAADF-STEM analysis confirmed the presence of amorphous carbon phases located between t-ZrO2 particles to form the t-ZrO2–C composite (Figure 1d–f). The carbon content was estimated to be 32 wt % for t-ZrO2–C on the basis of TG-DTA measurement (Figure S2a). As the calcination temperature is increased up to 1400 °C, t-ZrO2 was reduced by carbon, and the composite transformed into ZrC NPs (Figure 1c,g–i).",
