Typically, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.9 g) was dissolved in deionized water (20 mL) in a small beaker (50 mL) and transferred into a 100 mL autoclave (stainless steel). Then, carbon disulfide (10 mL) was introduced into the solution. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 400 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. The resulting product was filtered, washed several times with deionized water, and finally freeze-dried for 12 h.",

To produce more defects in the MoS2, we tried to anneal the CAT catalyst at above 450 °C (the sublimation temperature of MoS2) and used the treated catalysts for the reaction. Under the same reaction conditions, CAT-450 presented 100% conversion of nitrobenzene and 73.2% selectivity to N-benzyl aniline (Table 1, entry 2). Further extending reaction times to 5 h, the selectivity to N-benzyl aniline reached 85.2% (Table 1, entry 3), suggesting that the thermal treatment has a positive influence on the yield of secondary amine product. To further confirm the effectiveness of thermal sublimation, we used sodium molybdate as the precursor and obtained another kind of CAT-Na using the same hydrothermal synthesis procedure.",
