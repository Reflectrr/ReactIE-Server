By the literature synthesis routes for 1,1-bis(cyclopentadienyl)cyclohexane and -cycloheptane and subsequent treatment with dibutylmagnesium, a common approach in the synthesis of magnesocenophanes, we could obtain the cyclohexylidene- and cycloheptylidene-bridged magnesocenophanes 1b,c (Scheme 1).",

The formation of disilylamine 2c occurs very rarely and only in the donor solvents thf and dme, whereas in other solvents disilylamine 2c was not observed. Overall, a promising catalytic activity was observed in toluene, while the conversion was found to be much lower in thf, perhaps due to the coordinating nature of thf, which hinders substrate binding to the magnesium center. We therefore chose to conduct most of the catalytic reactions of this study in toluene.",

Notably, the best results could be achieved in the case of the reactions of benzylamine with diphenylsilane, selectively giving monosilazane 7a, under ambient conditions, with an 80% yield after just 8 h. When all reactions with primary amines were compared, benzylamine was more reactive than arylic and aliphatic amines, while in the case of secondary amines, reactions with dialiphatic amines give higher conversions.",

This suggests coordination of the amine to the magnesium atom in solution, giving a magnesocenophane amine complex (Scheme 5), and is in line with a previous report of magnesocene amine complexes. We were able to obtain single crystals of this magnesocenophane bis(benzylamine) complex, 1c·(BnNH2)2, as well as of a related tert-butylamine complex, from a thf solution at 248 K, allowing for a structural characterization by X-ray diffraction.",

Subsequently, the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature and storage at 248 K resulted in the crystallization of 1c·(BnNH2)2 as pale needles.",
