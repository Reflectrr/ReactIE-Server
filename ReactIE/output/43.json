Following the reaction, an iPr2NBH2 coordinated scandium hydride (7; Scheme 3) was obtained in 75% yield. Therefore, it is likely that a similar β-B-agostic scandium amidoborane intermediate formed initially, which was followed by a rapid β-H elimination to afford the final product.",

As expected, the reaction clearly gave DCC insertion product 8 in 76% isolated yield with the concomitant formation of the cyclic borazane A (Scheme 4 and Figure 3; for details, see the ExperimentalSection4 and Supporting Information). The scandocene hydride is also reported to react with heterocyclic compounds (e.g. pyridine) to afford the ortho C–H activation product with the release of H2. Thus, the reaction of 6 with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was also investigated.",

However, the reaction of scandocene alkyl 5 with iPr2NH·BH3 gave an aminoborane-coordinated scandocene hydride through a complete β-H elimination process. In addition, complexes 1 and 5 also exhibited very high activities for the catalyzed dehydrogenative cyclization of diamine–boranes to give N-heterocyclic boranes. This work shows that scandocene alkyls are highly active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of (di)amine–boranes and gives a deeper understanding of the β-H elimination of β-agostic metal complexes.",
