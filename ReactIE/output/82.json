After several conditions were screened, the neat reaction of allyl bromide (11) with n-propanol (12) (1.5 equiv) was performed at 35 °C using 1.7 equiv of solid NaOH as the base. Upon completion of the reaction, excess n-propanol and salts were removed by successive water washes to give 7 as a neat liquid.

Hydroformylation of olefin 2 with the catalyst prepared in situ from 1 mol % Rh(CO)2(acac) and 1 mol % Xantphos in THF at 75 °C under 1000 psi 1:1 H2/CO gave the linear aldehyde 2 in 61% isolated yield after column chromatography. Observation of a triplet at δ 9.68 (J = 1.6 Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 confirmed the product to be the linear aldehyde regioisomer. The branched isomer was not observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude product mixture. The high regioselectivity is presumably due to the significant steric difference between the terminal C6 and internal C5 of the olefin.",

Bisphosphite L1 provided several significant advantages over Xantphos. Use of L1 allowed the hydroformylation reaction to be performed at lower CO pressure, reaction temperature, and Rh loading than with Xantphos as the ligand. More importantly, the polarity of the aldehyde product combined with the nonpolar nature of the Rh–L1 catalyst system facilitated product isolation and catalyst recovery by nonaqueous biphasic extraction with subsequent catalyst recycling. Following hydroformylation of 2 with Rh–L1 in heptane at 70 °C in the next experiment, acetonitrile was added, and aldehyde 1 was isolated in 84% yield (97.2% purity by gas chromatography) by evaporation of the acetonitrile layer. A small amount of hydrogenation side-product 20 (1 area % by GC) was observed in the sample. The heptane layer contained a small amount of the aldehyde product (5% yield) along with byproduct 20 in a 91:9 ratio. The combined product yield was 91%. The catalyst was mostly partitioned into the heptane layer and was recycled for an additional hydroformylation experiment, which gave 1 in 64% yield with 95% purity after isolation.",
