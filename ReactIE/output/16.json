Although the optimization of Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira and Cacchi reactions involves many parameters, including metal precatalysts, ligands, additives, solvents, and temperatures, with the objective of rapidly developing a scalable process to provide the material required for preclinical studies, we conducted a ligand screen with the hope that optimizing this single parameter would provide a viable and reliable procedure.",

The performance of PPh3 and X-Phos as ligands in this screen was consistent with the initial attempts discussed above, while all of the other ligands gave either significant amounts of side product 8 or slow reactions. In a control experiment conducted on a gram scale under a N2 atmosphere, heating the BINAP reaction at 100 °C in an oil bath for 3 h led to a 21% yield of 8, while continued heating for an additional hour led to an increased amount of 8 (28%), indicating that controlling the temperature plays a significant role in limiting the formation of 8. At 80–83 °C for 16 h, the reaction proceeded both smoothly and cleanly to give 3 in 87% yield along with 8 in 13% yield. With satisfactory Cu-free Sonogashira conditions in hand, attention was turned to an examination of the Cacchi reaction. After the formation of 3, 1.2 equiv of 4 was added, and the reaction was monitored. At 80 °C, the reaction proceeded slowly; however, when the temperature was raised to 90 °C, the reaction was complete in 2 h. LCMS analysis showed an 80% yield of product 5 along with a 20% yield of side product 8. These reaction conditions reproducibly produced 5 at scales of tens of grams. It should be mentioned that because of a limited supply of high-quality racemic BINAP, (S)-BINAP was used for the large-scale preparations. The use of a 1:2 molar ratio of Pd(OAc)2 and (S)-BINAP and a lower catalyst loading resulted in incomplete reactions.",
