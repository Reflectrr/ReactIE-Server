In particular, there is interest in the generation of products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, and methanol from CO2, as they are currently synthesized from nonrenewable feedstocks. The direct hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid, formaldehyde, and methanol is the most atom efficient route to these products, but the best conditions for these reactions are harsh and we currently lack the ability to sustainably generate H2 on a large scale.",

However, the formation of triformatoborane is unexpected, as there was no evidence that this compound was directly formed during catalysis. We propose that this species results from decomposition of the boryl formate product, which is known to be unstable, after catalysis has finished. Consistent with this hypothesis, when a vacuum was applied to the boryl formate derived from HBPin and CO2, the formation of the known compound B2Pin3 was observed by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography (Scheme 1 and the Supporting Informationes1). The other decomposition product from this process is presumably triformatoborane, which balances the stoichiometry of the proposed decomposition pathway. Once generated, the triformatoborane can act as a Lewis acid and coordinate to the Lewis basic carbonyl oxygen in (tBuPCP)Pd{OC(O)H}.",

Given that there is no CO2 present in this reaction to directly form the methoxy borane product, this experiment establishes that bis(boryl)acetal can be converted into methoxy borane under the reaction conditions.",

This conversion is likely even slower in the presence of CO2, which lowers the concentration of the metal hydride catalyst. Moreover, the elementary steps involved in the conversion of bis(boryl)acetal to methoxy borane are likely slower for (tBuPCP)NiH, as it is the most sterically bulky catalyst studied in this work. As a consequence, (tBuPCP)NiH gives more bis(boryl)acetal with 9-BBN than the less sterically bulky (tBuPCP)PdH, which is able to more readily convert any bis(boryl)acetal that is formed to methoxy borane (see the Supporting Informationes1).",
