Then, the subsequent β-hydrogen elimination should lead to hydride C, bearing 4-pinalcolboryl-(3E)-1,3-hexadiene η2-coordinated through the terminal C–C double bond. Thus, the coordination of the internal C–C double bond of the generated diene followed by the migration of the hydride ligand from the rhodium atom to the boron-substituted carbon atom in the resulting intermediate D would give the allyl complex 4. Under catalytic conditions, the displacement of the coordinated C–C double bond of C by an alkyne molecule yields 4-pinalcolboryl-(3E)-1,3-hexadiene, whereas the generated hydride-π-alkyne species leads to the hydroborylation products (vide infra).",

The formation of both isomers of each olefin indicates that in both cases, the rate of the Z–E isomerization is similar to the rate of the reactions of the alkenyl isomers with the diborane. In the absence of the latter, the metal center of the E-alkenyl complexes is also able to promote the C–H bond activation of a Cγ–H bond of the alkyl substituent attached at the alkenyl Cα atom to generate the allyl derivatives 13 and 14, which leads to the internal olefins, boryl substituted at a terminal position, 1-pinacolboryl-2-hexene and 1-pinacolboryl-2-octene.
