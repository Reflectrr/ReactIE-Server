The batch synthesis (Scheme 1) used large volumes of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) solution (∼30 vol, ∼90 equiv) at low temperature with long reaction times, required a seeded isolation of unstable and potentially hazardous intermediate 1, and used the nonpreferred solvent dichloromethane (DCM) for the final workup and isolation of 3b.",
