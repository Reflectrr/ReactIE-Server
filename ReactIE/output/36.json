Salts 3a–e were characterized by their elemental analyses, mass and NMR spectra. The identifications of the CH units between the N atoms are of particular significance in the cations 3a–e as their 1H and 13C signals are observed, respectively, around δ 8.9 and 158 ppm, which is typical of such dihydroimidazolium salts.",

If complex 4c bearing cyclohexyl substituents led to poor results (entry 4), the use of complex 4d holding bulky tBu groups afforded product 5 in a high yield with a 49% ee (entry 5). Complex 4e bearing adamantyl substituents allowed a further increase of the steric hindrance and led to secondary alcohol 5 in high yield with an improved 60% ee (entry 7).",
