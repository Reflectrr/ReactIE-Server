Similarly, the attack toward the C–H bond of methyl leads to the formation of acrylate, and we labeled this pathway as AA. Based on FTIR spectra, the rapid disappearance of CC vibration when temperature increases signifies that the CC double bond becomes relatively easier to be activated, and the following EP pathway is more favorable to proceed.",

            "text": "Different from propene, as shown in Figure 6c, CO vibration is absent, while CC vibration is obvious during propane oxidation. Therefore, we regard acrylate as an important intermediate. In combination with the HOMO and FTIR spectra of propane, the adsorption of propane could occur at the terminal methyl. Thus, the first step is the dehydrogenation of terminal methyl and the formation of the C–O bond, that is, the formation of isopropyl (CH3CH2CH2*). Combining the appearance of ample acrylate on FTIR spectra, isopropyl easily loses four hydrogen atoms to generate acrylate (CH2CH–COO*). The following steps are similar to acrylate decomposition steps in the propene-AA pathway. The activation energy of acrylate decomposition is 1.48 eV. Thus, propane is harder to be oxidized than propene, being in agreement with the experimental activation energies (Figure 1b).",
