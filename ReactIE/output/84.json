Baeyer–Mills coupling of methyl (S)-2-amino-3-(4-aminophenyl)propanoate 3 with the corresponding aniline (unsubstituted aniline for AzoGW1929 or 4-chloroaniline for AzoGW1929-2) and subsequent Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling to the free amine of the amino acid afforded the methyl ester derivatives of the corresponding photohormones. Cleavage of the methyl esters with lithium hydroxide yielded AzoGW1929 and AzoGW1929-2.",
