            "text": "The distal superoxide oxygen then attacks the C-2 carbonyl of 2OG, resulting in oxidative decarboxylation with formation of succinate, carbon dioxide (which likely efficiently leaves the active site), and a Fe(IV)O intermediate, the latter of which is likely the active oxidant. The ferryl species then stereospecifically abstracts a hydrogen atom from C-3 of HIF-α Asn803 to form a substrate radical and ferric hydroxide; a radical rebound process then gives the hydroxylated product and restores the Fe(II) state. The hydroxylated product and succinate are then released, and the FIH-Fe(II) complex can transition into a new catalytic cycle (Figure 3).",
