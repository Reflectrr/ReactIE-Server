            "text": "Stoichiometric experiments show that Mn1 reacts readily with aldehydes, even in aprotic solvents such as benzene or THF. The addition of 1 equiv of 4-fluorobenzaldehyde to a solution of the Mn(I) hydride Mn1 in C6D6 revealed the formation of a new but minor manganese species (Scheme 5). The concentration of this compound did not change over time but grew with increasing amount of added substrate. Thus, addition of up to 20 equiv of aldehyde was required to observe complete conversion of the manganese hydride complex. The new compound was tentatively assigned as the alkoxide complex 6, generated by insertion of the aldehyde into the metal hydride bond of Mn1. Compound 6 could not be isolated and exhibited singlet resonances at 115.8 and 140.9 ppm in the 19F{1H} and 31P{1H} NMR spectra, respectively (free 4-fluorobenzyl alcohol exhibits a singlet at 116.1 ppm in the 19F{1H} NMR spectrum). In the IR spectrum, 6 displays the expected two signals of the symmetric and asymmetric CO stretching frequency at 1925 and 1848 cm–1 (cf. 1873 and 1790 cm–1 in Mn1). However, no further reaction took place when a benzene (or THF) solution of the in situ-generated alkoxide complex 6 was exposed to dihydrogen. There was also no catalytic reaction if a 3:1 mixture of THF/EtOH was used. Accordingly, EtOH as solvent is not required for the insertion step but obviously plays a crucial role in the subsequent dihydrogen activation step. Moreover, Mn1 did not react with 4-fluoroacetophenone in both aprotic and protic solvents.",

Exchange of benzyl alcohol by one H2 molecule produces intermediate G. Dihydrogen coordination is facile, with a barrier of only 1 kcal/mol (TSGH) in a clearly exergonic step, ΔG = −9 kcal/mol. The resulting intermediate H is an η2-H2 complex, which is 14 kcal/mol more stable than the initial reagents. Rearrangement of the H-bond network between the H2 complex and the nearby ethanol molecule changes H into I. In the final step, there is splitting of the H–H bond with re-protonation of the PNP N-atom and regeneration of the hydride ligand in J, corresponding to the initial reactant A and an ethanol molecule.",
