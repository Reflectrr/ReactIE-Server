Initially, stable SIPr-PdCl2-Py was selected as the catalyst because Pd–NHC is effective in the cleavage of C–N, C–S, and C–O bonds. Fortunately, a 65% yield of 4-methoxy-1,1′-biphenyl (3) was detected by HPLC with 5 mol % of SIPr-PdCl2-Py (Table 1, entry 1).",

It was shown that t-BuONa was the best base and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was the best solvent in all tested conditions. Increasing the amount of 2 from 1 to 1.5 equiv slightly improved the reaction (Table 1, entry 13), whereas increasing the amount of t-BuONa to 3 equiv significantly facilitated the reaction with a 90% yield of 3 (Table 1, entry 14). Further increasing t-BuONa to 4 equiv had a negligible effect on the reaction (Table 1, entry 15). The reaction went smoothly and was quite clean under the optimum conditions, as the desired product was mainly generated with only 6% of unreacted boronic acid 1, 3% of diphenyl sulfide, and sulfoxide 2 (0.51 equiv).",

Compared to that of its para- and meta-analogues, the reaction of ortho-substituted diaryl sulfoxide, 2,2′-sulfinylbis(methylbenzene) with 1 afforded comparable yield of the desired product (Table 2, 33–35). Thus, ortho-substitution did not diminish the yield of the product. Notably, 36 was generated in the yield of 82% when (sulfinylbis(4,1-phenylene))bis(trimethylsilane) was used, indicating that potentially labile trimethylsilyl (TMS) was inert in the reaction and thus facilitated further transformation.",

Usually, it is very difficult to successfully couple an electron-rich electrophile with an electron-deficient nucleophile, as it is well known that an electron-rich electrophile is not favorable to oxidative addition; meanwhile, an electron-deficient nucleophile is not beneficial for transmetalation.
