The low catalytic activity of Co/ZR1 was probably due to the low surface area, low amount of active sites (e.g., acid, base, metal, and Ov sites), low Co dispersion, and weak metal–support interaction (indicated by the easy reduction of Co species).",

Co/ZR3 possessed stronger metal–support interaction than Co/ZR2, as reflected in the H2-TPR results. Co/ZR2 with much higher SBET should have considerably higher Co dispersion than Co/ZR3, but the stronger metal–support interaction of Co/ZR3 made it similar for both samples.",
