They are suggested to be involved in the biosynthesis of mangiferin, a xanthonoid C-glucoside of various pharmacological potentials, including antioxidant and antidiabetic activity. Thus, further investigation of the catalytic potential of MiCGT and MiCGTb could be useful in pharmacological applications. Interestingly, we found that MiCGTb can catalyze the first C-glycosylation and successive second C-glycosylation of 2-phenyl-2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone (1) with UDP-Glc to yield a bis-C-glucosyl compound (1a), while MiCGT only produces the mono-C-glucosyl derivative (1b) (Scheme 1).",

Similarly, MiCGTb mutants with methionine, valine, or threonine were detected with enhanced activity for the second C-glycosylation of 1, and the I152 M mutant showed the highest activity (Figure S3).",
