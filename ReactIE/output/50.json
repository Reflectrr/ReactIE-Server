Thermal hazard analysis of the borohydride reduction revealed a high adiabatic temperature increase (89 °C) and a maximum heat flow of 455 W/kg. Portionwise addition of NaBH4 was used to help enable the safe venting of hydrogen gas generated during the addition.",

When using freebase 17, Cy2NMe was the preferred base, but if 17·HCl was used directly, potassium carbonate was the superior base, affording 29 in reasonable yield. This Heck reaction performed on compound 24 (Scheme 11) was considerably less efficient as significant participation of the aryl chlorides was observed. As expected, the alkene reduction could be achieved easily using palladium on carbon at modest pressure. The amide formation was facile using 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) as a simple, inexpensive, and nonallergenic coupling agent with easily purged byproducts. Identical TBS deprotection conditions were then employed to generate 3.",
