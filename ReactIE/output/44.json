Well-established diastereoselective alkylation to an Ellman’s imine of 21 enabled construction of the tert-amine 22 having the desired chiral stereocenter. The amine 22 was treated with HCl to remove both t-butyl sulfinyl and t-butyl groups, followed by borane reduction to afford the amino alcohol 23. After 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protection of the amino group, the primary alcohol was oxidized with 2-iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX), and the resulting aldehyde was converted to dimethylacetal, which was subsequently treated with piperidine to remove the Fmoc group to afford 24. The obtained amine was reacted with benzoyl isothiocyanate to form N-hydroxypropyl thiourea followed by cyclization under acidic conditions to give 25. After reduction of the nitro group using iron, the aniline 26 was successfully condensed with the corresponding carboxylic acids using 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride (DMT-MM) or 1-(3-dimehylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl) with 1 equiv of HCl to furnish the targeting thiazine 1 and its analogues 15–18.",
