As reported previously, exposure of a benzene-d6 solution of the iron precatalyst (2.5 mol % dimer, 5 mol % [Fe]) to an excess of propylene (1a) resulted in near complete (96%) consumption of 1a within 48 h at ambient temperature (∼23 °C) and formation of a mixture of dimerization products including [2+2]-cycloadduct 2a and tail-to-tail dimer 3a (Scheme 2A).",
