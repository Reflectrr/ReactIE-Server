That is, for the formation of dicarbonyl complexes the suggested pathway involves two elementary reaction steps: namely, (i) the doubly anionic Cl–/BF4– exchange of [R(CH2PPh2)2]NiCl2 with NaBF4 to give intermediate dications {[R(CH2PPh2)2]Ni}2+ and (ii) coordination of the two S atoms in (dppv)(CO)2Fe(pdt) with Ni atoms of the dicationic intermediates to give the final dicarbonyl complexes [1a]2+–[1c]2+. In addition, for the formation of μ-chloro complexes the possible pathway includes three elementary reaction steps: namely, (i) the singly anionic Cl–/BF4– exchange of [R(CH2PPh2)2]NiCl2 with NaBF4 to give intermediate monocations {[R(CH2PPh2)2]NiCl}+, (ii) coordination of the two S atoms in (dppv)(CO)2Fe(pdt) with Ni atoms of the monocationic intermediates to give intermediates [m1]+, and (iii) intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of the Fe-attached CO by the unshared electron pair of the Ni-attached Cl atom in [m1]+ to give the final μ-chloro complexes [2a]+–[2c]+. In addition, as shown in Scheme 3, the μ-chloro complexes [2a](BF4)–[2c](BF4) can be also obtained via coordination of the anion Cl– dissociated from [R(CH2PPh2)2]NiCl2 or Et4NCl to the unsaturated Ni atoms of the produced dicarbonyl complexes followed by intramolecular CO substitution of the resulting",
