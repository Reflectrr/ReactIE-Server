            "text": "In contrast, CO2 conversion increases to 58.2% when Ni is supported on the NH3-pretreated a-TiO2 support. More interestingly, CO2 is converted almost exclusively to CH4 over this catalyst (Figure 1b). Furthermore, we compared the product selectivity at the same CO2 conversion (4.9%) by varying the space velocity. As shown in Figure S1, Ni/a-TiO2–NH3 catalyst still exhibits a CH4 selectivity of nearly 90% while CO is still the only product on Ni/a-TiO2 catalyst. Such a significant difference in the activity and selectivity is surprising because the impregnation of nickel nitrate and the following calcination have been carried out in air for both catalysts.",

Detailed characterization by EPR, H2-chemisorption, and XPS reveals that the prereduction of the a-TiO2 support generates a large amount of Ti3+ in the bulk, which is likely the reason for suppressed formation of the titania overlayer and also altered SMSI.",

This simple reduction treatment provides an effective approach to tune the SMSI of metal catalysts over the reducible oxide supports and hence their catalytic activities.",
