Compound 9 reduces the production of IL-6 and MCP-1 in LPS-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and whole blood and suppresses MV4-11 lymphoblast leukemia cell growth (pIC50 = 7.0), indicating that BD1-selective inhibitor compound 9 is sufficient to maintain the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activity of pan-BET inhibition.",

The structural modification of an ABBV-075 analog leads to compound 13. 2,6-Dimethylphenyl ether in compound 13 contributes to BD2 selectivity, with a tertiary alcohol on the central phenyl ring suppressing the activity against BRD4-BD1 and a fluorine atom on the phenyl ether improving the pharmacokinetic properties of compound 13.",
