Ethylene diamines (C2 amines) are for instance used as curing agents in epoxy resins and as catalysts in polyurethane synthesis.

The alternative production of amines from biomass is a strongly growing field of interest, though still in its infancy. Our group recently demonstrated that glucose can be converted with an amine into 51 C% of the corresponding C2 diamine in one step. For instance, it was demonstrated that glucose can be converted into N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylene-diamine (TMEDA) in the presence of hydrogen and dimethyl amine (DMA), forming water as byproduct, according to the following reaction equation:",
