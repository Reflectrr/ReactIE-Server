            "text": "The preparation of 1 via Kulinkovich–Szymoniak from 2-cyanopyrimidine (2) and ethylmagnesium bromide has been described in a patent. Compound 1 was reported to be isolated via silica gel column chromatography (CC) in 30% yield on a 5 g scale. In addition, the synthesis of the 2-pyridine analogue of 1 also has recently been reported via a Kulinkovich–Szymoniak reaction using bis[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl]ether as a Grignard chelator. However, in our hands, the use of identical or similar conditions with 2-cyanopyrimidine (2) or N,N-dibenzylpyrimidine-2-carboxamide (3) and ethylmagnesium bromide in combination with Ti(OiPr)4 resulted in reaction mixtures with very low-purity profiles and dark aspects. More importantly, only traces of 1 (or N,N-dibenzylated 1) were generated.",

It was found that the cyclopropanation worked well with a combination of 1,3,2-dioxathiolane-2,2-dioxide (7) and lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LHMDS), and the intermediate ester 8 could be directly saponified by quenching with 1 M aq NaOH to give acid 4 in good yield (Scheme 2.). To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reported conditions for the direct cyclopropanation of 2-pyrimidyl esters.",
