            "text": "For determination of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis kinetics, assays were performed at 30 °C in a 1xPBS buffer pH 7.2 in a 96-well plate (Corning Costar). l-Alanine-p-nitroanilide (Ala-p-NA) and l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (Arg-p-NA) were prepared at escalating concentrations (0.5–6.0 mM) in the above buffer. Each of the 11 compounds were dissolved in 5% DMSO and added to each well at escalating concentrations (0–800 μM), followed by the addition of LTA4H (5–10 μg/mL) with a 10 min incubation period at 30 °C. The enzyme activity was measured by continuously monitoring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm after the addition of substrate for 20 min using a Bio-Tek Powerwave UV plate reader. A standard curve for p-nitroanilide released by the enzyme reaction was determined and used to determine the rate of p-nitroanilide formation.",
