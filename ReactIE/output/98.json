Under these conditions, the hydrogenation of α-methyl styrene produced >99% yield by 1H NMR spectroscopy of isopropyl benzene, while control reactions in the dark at room temperature reached <0.5% conversion (Scheme 2). Heating the hydrogenation to 100 °C for 18 h produced alkane in 37% yield.",

Subsequent exposure to 1 atm of H2 gas resulted in complete regeneration of 1 after 10 h at room temperature, demonstrating the ability of 1 to undergo HAT and subsequent reconstitution using hydrogen as the terminal reductant. Likewise, catalytic hydrogenation of 2,4,6-tert-butyl-phenoxy radical in the presence of 5 mol % 1 and 4 atm of H2 afforded 2,4,6-tert-butyl-phenol in >95% yield after 3 days, demonstrating the catalytic HAT performance of the cobalt hydride, 1 (Scheme 4b).",

Photodriven hydrogenation of vinyl cyclopropane, a radical clock with a fast (estimated 7 × 106 s–1 at 22 °C) ring-opening rate constant, produced only trace ring opening by 1H NMR spectroscopy, suggesting that radical intermediates are not formed during hydrogenations of 1 with blue light (see the Supporting Information for details).",
