            "text": "The transphosphatidylation is an enzymatic phosphatidyl group transfer reaction with a two-phase system of CHCl3-acetate buffer that effectively provides a variety of phospholipid derivatives from a phosphatidylcholine (phosphatidyl donor) and an alkanol (phosphatidyl acceptor). The initial attempt using free amine PEG units as phosphatidyl acceptors afforded almost none of the transphosphatidylation products, and most of the distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) remained intact, suggesting that the PLDP was denatured under the alkaline conditions due to the basic acceptors. Therefore, we used hydrochloride salts of the PEG units as acceptors, which gave the desired PL–PEG units 9–14 as transphosphatidylation products in excellent yields. Thus, we efficiently synthesized a series of the key PL–PEG units that could be generally used for the synthesis of various LPCs, by the PLDP-catalyzed transphosphatidylation.",
