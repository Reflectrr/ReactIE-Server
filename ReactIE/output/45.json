Unlike the alkyl and hydride species, reaction of 3 with an atmosphere of CO was found to produce a mixture of mono- and dicarbonyl adducts (3·CO and 3·(CO)2, Scheme 1). Under 2 atm of CO, the formation of 3·(CO)2 was predominant, as judged by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy, suggesting equilibrium binding of the second carbonyl ligand. Replacement of the CO atmosphere with N2 results in gradual formation of exclusively 3·CO over 12 h.",

Given the unlikelihood of tautomerization with 2-butyne, the structure of 8 displayed in eq  reflects a concerted 1,2-insertion, with the methyl groups of the vinyl ligand in a cis disposition. Indeed, crystallographic analysis of 8 (Figure 6) confirmed the expected stereocheimstry about the new vinyl ligand. Treatment of 8 with an additional 1 equiv of diphenylsilane regenerates 3 after several hours at elevated temperatures, thereby creating a conceptual cycle for catalytic alkyne hydrosilylation with 3. In contrast to the reactivity with alkynes, 3 demonstrated no insertion chemistry with styrene under similar conditions.",
