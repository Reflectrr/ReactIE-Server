Protection of 4-bromo-7-azaindole 2 was achieved using p-toluenesulfonyl chloride under basic conditions to provide N-tosyl-7-azaindole 3. Regioselective iodination of 3 using lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodine in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at −78 °C provided 2-iodoazaindole 4, which was subsequently subjected to Suzuki coupling with (5-formyl-2-methoxyphenyl)boronic acid to give 2-aryl substituted azaindole 5. Reductive amination of the aldehyde functionality of 5 was performed with various amines in the presence of sodium triacetoxyborohydride to give amines 6a–d in excellent yields. Next, the N-tosyl protecting group was removed under basic conditions at reflux for 18 h to yield 7a–d.
