Hydrochloric acid (1 M) was added during the workup, and the lengthy workup and isolation of 3 was replaced by extraction into hexane and use of this solution directly in the next reaction for the preparation of acetate 4. The use of sodium perborate and acetic acid has been reported to affect the controlled oxidation of a variety of functional groups including the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation of ketones to the corresponding esters via the “in situ” production of peracetic acid.

This revealed a significant induction period of around 40–50 min for reactions conducted at both 30 and 40 °C, when the sodium perborate was charged as a single portion at the start of the reaction (runs 1 and 2). Conversely, no induction period and a significantly increased rate of oxidation were observed when commercially available peracetic acid was employed as the oxidant (run 3). However, stirring a mixture of sodium perborate in acetic acid for 21 h at 30 °C prior to charging acetophenone 3 gave a slightly slower reaction rate than with peracetic acid alone (run 4). Generating peracetic acid from sodium perborate also produces sodium acetate, but the reaction rate obtained after charging sodium acetate as an additive to an oxidation using peracetic acid (run 5) was somewhat faster than with aged sodium perborate. The possibility of hydrogen peroxide as the active oxidant was not investigated but cannot be discounted. The data suggests that a gradual buildup of active oxidant occurs in the reaction and, if formed, the inventory of peracetic acid in the reaction is expected to be low. On this basis, the use of sodium perborate in place of m-CPBA, or the potentially explosive peracetic acid, appeared to offer a safer, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly approach for this transformation.",

The use of flammable solvent hexane, which could also be a static risk potential leading to ignition, was a concern; therefore, it was decided to remove this solvent during the reaction and conduct the process in acetic acid alone, thus minimizing the ignition side of the fire triangle. Acetic acid has a flash point of 40 °C, so conducting the process at a lower temperature should remove the “fuel” side of the fire triangle. Product 4 was also shown to be thermally unstable, and it decomposes slowly at elevated temperatures and should not be subjected to temperatures exceeding 70 °C; therefore, conducting the process and product workup and isolation at temperatures lower than 39 °C removes any concern. Process safety evaluation of the reaction of sodium perborate with acetic acid demonstrated that portion-wise addition of sodium perborate tetrahydrate to the mixture of acetic acid and 3 at 28–33 °C resulted in an endothermic event.",
