In the case of the alkyl ketones, the observed data again are consistent with the prediction of the model stating that lesser steric effects yield more C–H insertion product. Indeed, while methyl ketone 1g, with r value of 2.89 Å, reacted favorably to form the C–H insertion product 8g in 75% yield, no C–H insertion product was obtained with t-butyl ketone 1j, with r value of 3.25 Å. Instead, cyclobutyl ketone 10j was isolated as the major product resulting from intramolecular C–H insertion into one of the t-butyl methyl C–H bonds.",
