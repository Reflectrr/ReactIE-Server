One result from these studies was that water serves as an oxygen donor for the oxidation of formaldehyde. Consequently, the highest selectivity was achieved for pure methanol, but only a value of 60% with respect to the H2 yield was found.",

The TOF of this reaction shows a saturation behavior, starting at a pressure of 5 × 10–8 mbar (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information for an enlargement of methyl formate TOF). A comparison of both carbon-based products (i.e., methyl formate and formaldehyde) as a function of laser power reveals that a further photon is needed for the reaction to methyl formate (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).",
