Arylbenzoxazoles 4 were directly synthesized by oxidative cyclization methods using 2-amino-4-nitrophenol and aldehyde in the presence of activated carbon (Darco KB) under an oxygen atmosphere. The nitro group was reduced using Pd/C under 1 atm hydrogen to give 5-amine-2-arylbenzoxazoles 5. Enantiomerically pure phenyl ethers 6 were synthesized from (+)-methyl D-lactate and the corresponding phenol using Mitsunobu reaction conditions. The esters 6 were hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids 7 and then coupled with various 5-amine-2-arylbenzoxazoles in the presence of EDC·HCl in DMF to yield 8. Furthermore, 8 (Ar = 4-OMePh, R = 2,3-diCl) was treated with Lawesson’s reagent under standard conditions to generate thioamide 9 quantitatively. Ester 6a was also treated with 1 M DIBAL-H in DCM at −78 °C to generate aldehyde 10, which was subjected to reductive amination using 5 (Ar = 4-OMePh) and sodium triacetoxyborohydride in DCM to provide amine 11.",
