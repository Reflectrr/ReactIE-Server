Compound 41 was prepared by subjecting isoindoline 39 and chloride 19 to general conditions (f) and (i) to give the benzyl protected 40. Hydrogenolysis, followed by alkylation with 4-(Boc-amino)butyl bromide, and Boc deprotection, gave the amino functionalized 41 (Scheme 3). The affinity probe 41 was coupled to NHS-activated sepharose beads and incubated with SCC040 cell lysates in the presence of compound 35 or 38. Label-free quantification (LFQ) protein mass spectrometry was used to identify compound-specific interactors. The SCC040 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell line was chosen because SPIN1 expression in squamous cell carcinoma tumors was strongly correlated to smooth muscle actin and galectin-1, which may contribute to cell invasion and proliferation.",
