The reaction led to the isolation of green solid, [(Cp*MoCO)2(μ-H)2B4H4], 1, in good yield (40%). Isolation of 1 provide direct evidence for the existence of saturated molybdaborane compound [(Cp*Mo)2B4H10] (II) which was hypothesized earlier as [(Cp*Mo)2B4H8] (I). In addition, compound 1 fills the gap between [(Cp*MoCl)2B3H7] and [(Cp*Mo)2B5H9] clusters. Therefore, the tungsten system became of interest to validate the composition of the proposed intermediate. As a result, we explored the tungsten system and isolated [(Cp*WCO)2(μ-H)2B4H4] (2) that indeed justifies our assumption. In addition, when we performed the reactions with [W(CO)5·thf], under similar reaction conditions it generated [(Cp*Mo)2(CO)(μ-Cl)B3H4W(CO)4] (3) and [(Cp*WCO)2(μ-H)2B3H3W(CO)4] (4), which are indeed analogous to 1 and 2 considering the fact that one of the BH vertices is substituted by isolobal [W(CO)4] fragment.",
