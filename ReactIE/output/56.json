            "text": "The initial route started from 3-methoxybenzoic acid (2), which was condensed with formaldehyde under acidic conditions to form the corresponding phthalide 3 in moderate yield. This was subsequently transformed to the aldehyde 4 via a two-step procedure including the bromination of the methylene group under Wohl–Ziegler conditions, followed by basic hydrolysis with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The next step introduced the second half of the suberone scaffold via a Wittig reaction.",

            "text": "Therefore, the Wittig reagent was prepared in situ by refluxing equimolar amounts of 3-chlorobenzylchloride and triphenylphosphine in methanol, prior to the addition of aldehyde 4 and sodium methanolate. The equimolar formation of triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct of the Wittig reaction complicated the workup of this step. After aqueous quench, the crude reaction mass had to be extracted several times with DCM, to remove majority of the phosphine oxide while carboxylic acid 5 remained in the basic aqueous phase. The crude product was obtained after acidification and had to be further purified via recrystallization, resulting in a low yield of only 40%. In advance of the final ring closure to the dibenzosuberone scaffold, the double bond of stilbene 5 was reduced via a standard hydrogenation procedure. An observed side reaction was the dehydrohalogenation of the chloro substituent, but this was kept on an acceptable level and a final recrystallization from aqueous methanol afforded compound 6 in good yield. The main issue in this step was the low solubility of the free carboxylic acid (30 mL per gram 5) which resulted in large reaction volumes. The ring closure to the suberone core was performed as a two-step procedure initiated by the activation of the carboxylic acid function with thionyl chloride and subsequent intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation without the isolation of the acid chloride intermediate. The workup of this reaction suffered from a slow phase separation after aqueous quench and the crude product required chromatographic purification resulting in a moderate yield of 58% for this step. The final deprotection of the methoxy group was carried out under acidic conditions using aqueous hydrobromic acid along with acetic acid as cosolvent.",

These conditions were already applied in the original route and did not need significant modifications to afford satisfying reaction profiles. The workup procedure was slightly customized to remove the aforementioned discoloration from the condensation step and decrease the ratio of des-chlorinated impurities to a tolerable level. The workup started with quenching the reaction in aqueous methanol, affording 8 as a granular precipitate, which was readily filterable and already showed a purity of >95% (HPLC). For further purification, the crude material was refluxed with activated carbon in an EtOAc/MeOH mixture followed by partial evaporation of the solvents and isolation of the precipitate by filtration. An additional second crop of high purity was obtained by evaporation of the mother liquor and recrystallization of the residue from MeOH.",
