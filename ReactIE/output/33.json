            "text": "Subsequently, Lamb and Gates demonstrated the formation of anionic Os4 and Os10 carbonyl clusters on MgO from a mononuclear precursor under catalytic CO hydrogenation conditions. The weakly acidic hydrido carbonyl complex H2Os(CO)4 chemisorbed on MgO to form [HOs(CO)4]−. IR spectroscopy and solid-state 13C NMR suggested that the anion interacted strongly with {Mg2+} via a μ2-η2 CO ligand. Extraction of surface-bound anions using [N(PPh3)2]Cl/CH2Cl2 yielded [N(PPh3)2][HOs3(CO)11] consistent with the redox condensation chemistry in solution: [H3Os4(CO)12]− and [Os10C(CO)24]2– were formed on the MgO surface during CO hydrogenation catalysis at 548 K and 10 atm (3:1 H2:CO) for >18 h; these were the only Os species detected on the used catalyst. The products of the catalytic reaction were C1–C4 hydrocarbons as observed previously for catalysts derived from Os3(CO)12 on MgO. That these specific Os carbonyl clusters were formed from [HOs(CO)4]− via redox condensation under reaction conditions is consistent with their solution chemistry. Thus, Gates’s research showed that strong basicity and a CO + H2 atmosphere were keys to stabilizing molecular Os carbonyl clusters on a metal oxide support under high-temperature reaction conditions. The [H3Os4(CO)12]− /MgO was implicated in the catalysis, and [Os10C(CO)24]2–/MgO was thought to be associated with catalyst deactivation.",

The data demonstrated that the formation of Ir4 clusters from Ir(C2H4)2 in zeolite Y cages during a temperature ramp (to 353 K in H2) occurs first through conversion of π-bonded C2H4 into ethyl ligands and a decrease in Ir–C coordination number from ∼4 to ∼2.",
