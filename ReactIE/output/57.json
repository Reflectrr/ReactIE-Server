Indeed, the cis,trans-3a bromohydrin was isolated at a yield of 49% and with an excellent de (>99% by 1H NMR). In contrast, the reduction of the same substrate with Method B gave mainly the 3-methylcyclohexan-1-ol and the trans,trans-3a isomer was present just in traces (Table 1).",

In this regard, it is noteworthy that the 5-chloro derivatives of actinol, that is, the chlorohydrins trans,trans-3g and cis,trans-3g, were obtained with our methodology in good yield and with high optical purity.",
