            "text": "Monoamidate 18c was prepared in moderate yield by direct coupling of the amidate reagent in the presence of MgCl2 to nucleoside 4. A higher yielding and more robust procedure that coupled the desired amidate reagent to the 2′,3′-acetonide protected nucleoside 17, followed by removal of the acetonide, was also developed. For example, monoamidate 18k was prepared in a 62% overall yield from the protected nucleoside 17. The diastereomeric monoamidate mixture 18j was separated by chiral chromatography to afford 1 and 1-Rp. Later, a stereospecific synthesis was developed and the two diastereoisomers were assigned by determination of the small-molecule X-ray structure of the more potent isomer 1.",

            "text": "More substantial potency gains were realized with 5′-phosphate prodrugs that bypass the first phosphorylation step in the conversion of 4 to its intermediate 5′-monophosphate in cells and thereby enhance the formation of 1-NTP (Table 3). The dithioester phosphate prodrug 15 was earlier found to improve the activity of 4 toward HCV in hepatic Huh-7 cells, confirming that, at least in hepatic cells, there is evidence for inefficient metabolism of 4 to its monophosphate. However, in the HEp-2 cell RSV assay, 15 demonstrated only a small improvement in RSV potency and a relatively low selectivity index. The prodrug following thioester cleavage releases an episulfide, which may be the root cause for the reduced selectivity.",
