In this example, the phosphate is rapidly and extensively cleaved to give 21, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that binds to the receptor in a U-shape conformation and interacts with the hinge through the pyrimidine N1 and N2 on the linker.",

            "text": "Activation of Src kinase Lck, shown in orange in Figure 13 leads to phosphorylation of the CD3 ITAM, resulting in ZAP-70 activation, phosphorylation, and subsequent phosphorylation of a complex comprising linker of activated T-cells (LAT, in brown in Figure 13) and Src homology 2 domain containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76, in navy in Figure 13) by ZAP-70. Activation of this complex allows for ITK (in green) recruitment to the membrane where it becomes phosphorylated by Lck. Phosphorylation of ITK activates the kinase, and upon autophosphorylation of Tyr180 in the SH3 domain, ITK is primed for interaction with and phosphorylation of PLCγ1 lipase. PLCγ1 then hydrolyzes phosphoinositol diphosphate (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG), leading to stimulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and NF-κB, respectively.",
