The first synthesis of rufinamide, which was described in U.S. Patent 4,789,680, starts with the reaction of 2,6-difluorobenzyl bromide (1) with sodium azide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent at room temperature for 2 h to obtain 2,6-difluorobenzyl azide (2) (Scheme 1), which further undergoes the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction with propiolic acid (3) at 70 °C for several hours in toluene as the solvent to afford 1-(2,6-difluorobenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carboxylic acid (4). The choice of propiolic acid as the dipolarophile is based on its low toxicity and its high reactivity due to the higher electronic deficiency. Furthermore, reacting compound 4 with SOCl2 and distilling out the excess SOCl2 gives 1-(2,6-difluorobenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carbonyl chloride (5), which subsequently reacts with aqueous ammonia in toluene solution to produce rufinamide (7). The patent described another process in which 4 is reacted with methanol in the presence of H2SO4 to get methyl 1-(2,6-difluorobenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carboxylate (6) in good yield, which further reacts with methanolic ammonia solution to afford rufinamide 7 in moderate yield. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of 2 with 3 was carried out on a 36 g scale. The moderate yield of 7 could be attributed to the formation of a mixture of the 1,4- and 1,5-regioisomeric cycloadducts.",
