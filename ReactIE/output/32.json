            "text": "We reported conditions for the formation of styrene from benzene and ethylene catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2 using copper(II) pivalate [Cu(OPiv)2] in the presence of purified dioxygen to yield ∼2400 TOs of styrene with >85% selectivity. The keys to increase selectivity for styrene are applying low ethylene pressure (20 psig) to reduce the production of undesired vinyl pivalate and high reaction temperature (180 °C) to facilitate the conversion of vinyl pivalate and benzene to styrene. Also, we recently demonstrated that under optimized conditions, (5-FP)Rh(TFA)(η2-C2H4) (TFA = trifluoroacetate, 5-FP = 1,2-bis(N-7-azaindolyl)benzene) can catalyze aerobic benzene alkenylation in the presence of Cu(OPiv)2 with air as the insitu oxidant to produce >13,000 TOs of propenylbenzene products with no evidence of catalyst deactivation. We developed a Rh-catalyzed aerobic alkenylation reaction for synthesis of stilbene derivatives from simple arenes and styrenes in good to high yields with good functional-group tolerance. The reaction proceeds with air as a terminal oxidant in the presence of air-recyclable copper(II) pivalate co-oxidant.",

            "text": "We speculated that the increase of the L/B ratio results from different rates of reaction of the four phenylpropylene products instead of the change of intrinsic catalyst L/B selectivity. To test this hypothesis, we added the four phenylpropylene products (the concentrations are approximately those of phenylpropylene products after 24 h of catalysis at 170 °C) at the beginning of a catalytic reaction using benzene and ethylene to produce styrene. As catalytic styrene production proceeds, the L/B ratio increased from an initial 5.5:1 to 8.3(3):1 after 12 h and was determined to be 35(3):1 after 36 h (Figure 6).",

The isomerization of branched α-methylstyrene to linear products catalyzed by Rh could increase the observed L/B ratio.

Notable hallmarks include the following: (1) the catalysis uses commercially available RhCl3 salt as catalyst precursor in the absence of additional additives and ligand, (2) the catalysis can use unpurified air or oxygen as the sole oxidant and does not require other co-oxidants, (3) the Rh catalysts can achieve a TON >1000 under optimized conditions. A first-order dependence on O2 oxidant was observed, which is indicative of a kinetically relevant O2 oxidation step.",
