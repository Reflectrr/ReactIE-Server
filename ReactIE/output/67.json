This search revealed that blue LED irradiation of α-1-bromo-d-glucoside 1 (0.2 mmol, 1 equiv) and primary alcohol 2 (0.3 mmol, 1.5 equiv) as model substrates with CuI (10 mol %), 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (XantPhos, 25 mol %), 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phennathroline (BPhen 25 mol %), and acid scavenger di-tert-butylmethylpyridine (DTBMP) in acetonitrile at 25 °C for 24 h afforded the coupling product 3 in good yield with excellent levels of diastereoselectivity (70%, α:β = 13:1, Table 1, entry 1). Control experiments established that copper, both ligands (XantPhos and BPhen), acid scavenger (DTBMP), and blue LED irradiation are essential to achieve anomeric C(sp3)–O bond formation (entries 2–10).",

Because the visible-light-mediated copper catalysis is unlikely to proceed through the traditional SN2–SN1 pathway and the stereochemical outcome of the coupling product is likely to be controlled by the [Cu(BPhen)(Xantphos)]+ complex, we hypothesize that this catalytic copper system could overcome the limitations previously associated with the phenanthroline system. To validate our hypothesis, the coupling of α-glycosyl bromide 4 with the C4-hydroxy of l-rhamnoside 5 was conducted to afford the desired product 6 (Table 2, entry 1) in good yield and excellent levels of diastereoselectivity (74%, α:β > 20:1).",

As expected, the photoinduced copper catalysis (12 and 14, α:β > 20:1) is more α-selective than the phenanthroline catalysis (12, α:β = 7:1 and 14, α:β = 5:1).
