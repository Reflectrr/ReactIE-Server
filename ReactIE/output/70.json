Treatment of benzyl alcohol (3) with aniline (4) in the presence of NaOtBu (0.1 mol %) and 2 (0.02 mol %) in an open vessel resulted in no reaction. We hypothesized that the dehydrogenation of 3 is highly endothermic (which was also subsequently confirmed by computational studies; vide infra) and the product 3′ undergoes a facile reverse reaction rather than forming 5′ and water. With an intent to scavenge water and push the equilibrium toward 5′, the reaction was repeated with 0.75 equiv of NaOtBu under otherwise identical conditions. Analysis of the reaction mixture indicated significant amounts of 5′ in addition to 5 (eq 1, Scheme 2). The highly viscous reaction medium due to stoichiometric amounts of base results in poor removal of H2 and hence results in the formation of hydrogenated product 5.",
