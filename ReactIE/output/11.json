The synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical derivatives is shown in Scheme 1. The requisite precursor 5,6-dichloro-[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine (7) was synthesized from the reaction of diaminofurazan 6 and oxalic acid in an aqueous 10% HCl solution, followed by chlorination with PCl5/POCl3. Intermediate 7 was then directly substituted with various alkyl or aryl amines in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to afford the desired symmetrical derivatives 8. To synthesize the unsymmetrical derivatives, compound 7 was reacted with an equivalent of 2-fluoroaniline and triethylamine in THF followed by the addition of a different amine to yield the unsymmetrical derivatives 10.",
