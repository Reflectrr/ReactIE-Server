            "text": "Whereas the reaction of phosphorus(III) amides with protic pronucleophiles commonly leads to phosphitylation by metathetical exchange, compound 1 undergoes intermolecular oxidative addition of amine N–H and alcohol O–H bonds to give pentacoordinate σ5-P adducts 1·[H][E] (E = OR, NHR). In situ spectroscopy demonstrated that the observed oxidative addition reactions proceed via a stepwise mechanism involving initial E–H bond cleavage by phosphorus-ligand cooperation, followed by subsequent intramolecular σ3-P → σ5-P tautomerism (Figure 1, top). In the case of volatile amines and alcohols, the reductive elimination from σ5-P adducts of 1 was also demonstrated, evidently tracing the reverse sequence of steps according to the principle of microscopic reversibility.",
