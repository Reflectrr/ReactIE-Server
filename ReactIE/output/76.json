The current mechanistic understanding of these reactions is largely based on seminal work by Kochi, who showed that the reaction of substituted aryl halides with Ni0(PEt3)4 leads to the oxidative addition products [NiII(PEt3)2(Ar)X] or paramagnetic [NiIX(PEt3)3] species. The solvent-caged radical pair [NiI(PEt3)3+ArX•–] was proposed as the common intermediate for both products (Figure 1a).",

The exothermicity of the oxidative addition is in line with previous computational results with three monophosphine ligands, but bromide abstraction from PhBr starting from Ni(PMe3)4 was found to be much less unfavorable, at only +1.9 kcal mol–1. Regarding the reaction of 1 with p-tolyl bromide (Figure 5), DFT calculations suggest a mechanism involving initial substitution of BPI by 4-bromotoluene to form a metastable π complex lying 13.4 kcal mol–1 above the reactants, followed by oxidative addition.",
